<!-- in html there are semantic elements that can be used to define different parts of the web  -->
<!-- header nav main aside section footer  -->
<!-- header has a built in role of banner like <header role ="banner"> -->
<!-- coming to the aside and  <section> tags -->
<!-- aside is related to the main content while the section is not related -->

<!-- button element should only be used if there is any interaction or action on the current page -->
 <!-- the anchor element should be used for any interaction that navigates to another view  -->

 <!-- the index.html in which we have used two anchor links instead of button -->

 <!-- if there is a button when clicked gives us a drop down menu on current page ,so this interaction performs an action on the current page ,so using button here is a correct thing to do  -->
  <!-- and a button with arrow indication that it is a drop down menu that changes directio when opened this is a nice extra visual cue  -->
  
  
  <!-- semantic html gives context to screen readers, which read contents of the page out loud   -->
   <!-- so in this case using div is wrong  -->
    <!-- as the button has more styling options just like the arrow and it is focusable clickable -->

    <!-- coming to the links  -->
     <!-- we use href to specify the URL if we use https://blavlala it is an absolute url where ./about is a relative url -->

     <!-- it is not recommended to open the links in the another new window -->
      <!-- <a href="./about/">about us </a> -->
