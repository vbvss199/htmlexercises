Single Page Applications (SPA) and router DOM 
a spa is a web app that loads only one html page and then updates the content dynamically as the user interacts without reloading the entire page 

<!-- for this we use react router dom to make single page applications work -->
User clicks a link (/login)

URL changes in the browser

No full page reload

React Router renders the matching component
and change the main.jss in order to use it 


once see the useState and useEffect hooks in react 

<!-- install axios for the http request from frontend !!!!!! -->
npm i axios react-icons
